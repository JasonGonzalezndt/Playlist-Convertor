Playlist convertor designed to use the Spotify API and the Apple Music API.

I built this without the Spotipy library to better learn the OAuth process as this was my first time working with it. If ran, this will create a local page prompting you to login.
You will then have an Auth token requested and saved using the Flask Session module and then using some of Flask's features I setup templates to display some of the data for both all of your playlists, and then if clicked, the songs within the playlists themselves.

Once I have more cash I plan to go back and purchase a year long access to Apple's musickit and complete this project.
